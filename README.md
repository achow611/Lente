## Solution Details
Lente is a novel marketplace that allows consumers to browse and shop sustainable apparel through a touch of a finger. Currently, consumers who are wishing to find new clothing but want to do so consciously and sustainably have limited access to finding truly sustainable clothing. They can search for sustainable brands online on Google, however, there are blog posts, guides, websites with their own rankings, etc. that do not truly give consumers a good experience nor are consumers confident in these sites especially with greenwashing on the rise. Lente is our attempt to make sustainable shopping easy, accessible, and informative for consumers.

## Built With
We used [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to build our solution as it would give us real time experience and feel of what the website and mobile app can look like. This also gave us the opportunity to share the website to some target consumers who gave us feedback on how to improve our marketplace.

## Technical Details
Using our background in Sustainability Management, we have analyzed the different certifications in the fashion industry. Sustainability does not include just environmental impacts but also social and governance impacts. Therefore, we looked at certifications that would indicate fashion organizations that not only limit their environmental harm, but ones that also aim to benefit the environment such as using a portion of their profit towards afforestation and carbon removal projects. The certification should also show that the organization is treating their employees as well as those involved in the entire supply chain process are treated equitably and fair. The organizations should also be transparent with their sustainability metrics and operations. From our research, we found the B Corp certification to be the most holistic and great starting point to indicate an organizations' sustainability performance. Therefore, we are starting with B Corp apparel companies from Canada on our marketplace. From there, we will expand to other certifications as well as other countries.
