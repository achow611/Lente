# Lente

## Solution Details
Lente is a novel marketplace that allows consumers to browse and shop sustainable apparel through a touch of a finger. Currently, consumers who are wishing to find new clothing but want to do so consciously and sustainably have limited access to finding truly sustainable clothing. They can search for sustainable brands online on Google, however, there are blog posts, guides, websites with their own rankings, etc. that do not truly give consumers a good experience nor are consumers confident in these sites especially with greenwashing on the rise. Lente is our attempt to make sustainable shopping easy, accessible, and informative for consumers.

## Built With
We used [Squarespace] (https://www.squarespace.com/) to build our solution as it would give us real time experience and feel of what the website and mobile app can look like. This also gave us the opportunity to share the website to some target consumers who gave us feedback on how to improve our marketplace.
